                            <p>I’m a passionate software developer with a love for all things coding and collaborating.</p>
                            <p>At 13 years old, I created one of the most popular custom games in the Warcraft III community, A World Ablaze. I held multiple beta-test playthroughs throughout development and fostered a community that would provide feedback and generate excitement for the game’s eventual release. The custom game mode garnered over 5,000 downloads over it’s lifetime, a hefty number in a small community of gamers.</p>
                            <p>At 17 years old, I began creating custom websites for family friends and anyone who wanted to work with an eager upstart kid from Texas to help hone his skills. I created everything from a photography website with a custom RESTful user login system, to a jewelry-selling website using the old-school PayPal API and the cutting edge jQuery JavaScript library.</p>
                            <p>This passion would lead me to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Master’s Degree in Interactive Technology from Southern Methodist University. While in graduate school, I served as Lead Programmer on a team of 17 developers creating the virtual reality video game Mouse Playhouse, regarded as the best Senior Design project to come out of the program by professors. Our work on Mouse Playhouse resulted in our entire grad team being hired by Gearbox Software, a world-class video game development studio, and creating the virtual reality game Penn & Teller VR.</p>

                    <h3>Tiled Forward+ Rendering</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The tiled forward renderer consists of the following steps:</li>
                        <li>Light culling compute shader pass</li>
                        <li>Pre-depth pass for opaque geometry occlusion</li>
                        <li>Opaque geometry render pass</li>
                        <li>Translucent geometry render pass</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>At the beginning of the render step for each frame, a compute shader is run that cuts the screen up into a discrete number of tiles, back-computes camera frustums for each tile, then runs intersection tests on each light in the scene and collects those light's indices into a buffer for each corresponding tile. The tiles are computed in 16x16 pixel groups, to take advantage of GPU architecture. Pixels share memory pools with neighboring pixel in small groups, typically in collections of 8x8 or 16x16 pixels.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt1.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >The compute pass carves the screen up into tiles, finds which lights intersect with which tiles, and places them into an index buffer for each tile.</p>
                    <p>During the base lighting pass, each fragment invocation determines which tile it belongs to, then goes through the index buffer and considers only the lights for that tile. In a traditional forward pipeline, each fragment rendered (even if not within view of the camera) would need to go through each light in the light list and consider it for shading. By tiling the camera frustum, we dramatically reduce the amount of lighting calculations that must be done per fragment.</p>

                    <p>The artifact was profiled with a traditional forward pipeline, the implemented tiled forward approach, with and without a pre-depth pass, and light sizes of 1-2 meters and 3-6 meters. The two most relevant results are pictured below, to demonstrate the massive decrease in rendering times with a forward+ pipeline.</p>

                    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'>
                        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/OrganicGlossyGrayling' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">Demonstrating the real-time shadowmap</p>
                    <p>The shadow map is constructed by first creating 6 camera frustums at 90 degree angles at the point where the shadows should be cast. The scene is then rendered 6 times with depth only, amortized to once per frame, to each side of a depth cubemap. During the base pass, if a material is defined to receive shadows, each fragment projects its position to the point light's position and normalizes it to the [0, 1] range so it can sample into the depth cubemap. If it is further from the light than the point sampled in the cubemap, it is determined to be in shadow.</p>
                    <p>Naive sampling of the cubemap can lead to egregious artifacts in the rendered scene. The three most obvious are shadow acne, peter panning, and perspective / projective aliasing.</p>

                    <h4>Shadow Acne</h4>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt4.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">An example of shadow acne in the scene</p>
                    <p>Shadow acne is due to the texel density mismatch between the shadowmap and the material being rendered. The shadowmap is typically much smaller than whatever material is currently being sampled, so stair-stepping happens as the material samples into the shadowmap. Shadow acne can be fixed by subtracting a very small epsilon value when sampling into the depth map.</p>

                    <h4>Peter Panning</h4>
                    <p>Peter panning occurs due to the epsilon value that is subtracted when sampling into the shadowmap. This makes the angle that's being sampled shallower, and can "pull" shadows off of thin geometry, making them look like they're floating.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt5.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">An example of peter panning in the scene</p>
                    <p>While peter panning cannot be entirely alleviated using this shadowmapping technique, it can be mostly mitigated by ensuring that the epsilon value is sufficiently small.</p>

                    <h4>Perspective and Projective Aliasing</h4>
                    <p>Perspective aliasing occurs because the ratio because of the texel density mismatch between the shadowmap and the surface being rendered.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt6.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">An example of perspective aliasing in the scene</p>
                    <p>One approach to alleviating perspective aliasing is by using percentage closer filtering of the shadowmap, which ups the number of samples taken per-pixel rendered on a surface but dramatically improves the perspective aliasing as seen above. To do percentage closer filtering, a sampling disk is constructed around the point being sampled and scaled by the distance of the fragment to the camera, so that shadows closer to the viewer are softer and computation time is not spent softening those further away. Once the sampling disk is constructed and samples have been taken from the shadowmap their values are then summed up and divided by the number of samples to yield a "percent-in-shadow" value, which is then used to multiply into the Lambertian diffuse and Blinn-Phong specular component of the shadow casting light.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt7.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">An example of projective aliasing in the scene</p>
                    <p>Projective aliasing occurs as the tangent plane of the geometry becomes parallel to the shadow casting light's direction. It can be alleviated somewhat by using the percentage closer filtering technique as described above, but cannot be entirely alleviated with this technique.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Screen-space Ambient Occlusion</h3>
                    <p>Screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) is a technique to approximate ambient occlusion between geometry in real-time. The technique used here is based on a hemispherical based sampling approach originally developed by Crytek.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt8.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">An example of ambient occlusion</p>
                    <p>This specific approach to SSAO consists of a full screen pass before the base lighting pass and after the pre-depth pass, that uses both the depth buffer and a map of the scene normals in view-space that is rendered out with the pre-depth pass. Each fragment sampled uses a constructed sampling hemisphere oriented the normal sampled from the scene normals map. For each point in the sampling hemisphere, a depth value is sampled from the depth buffer for occlusion - the amount of occluded samples in the depth buffer divided by the number of samples taken becomes the AO factor that is written into the SSAO buffer.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt9.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">The unblurred SSAO buffer</p>
                    <p>The sampling hemisphere used must be rotated for every other pixel in the SSAO buffer for two reasons. First, if the same sampling hemisphere is not used across each pixel, then it must be reconstructed for every pixel in the buffer which can add a significant amount of time to the SSAO pass. Second, if the sampling hemisphere is not rotated, it creates artifacting that does not resemble AO.</p>
                    <p>After rotating the sampling hemisphere for every other pixel, the resultant buffer appears grainy and it shows in the final rendered scene. To account for this graininess, a depth-sensitive blur pass is run on the SSAO buffer.</p>

                    <h3>Order-Independent Transparency</h3>
                    <p>This approach to order-independent transparency (OIT) is based on Morgan McGuire's approach, Weighted Blended Order-Independent Transparency. The motivation behind OIT lies in the non-commutative property of the alpha blending operation:</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt12.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">The alpha blending operation</p>
                    <p>If meshes are non-intersecting, a simple back-to-front sorting of meshes with transparency can be done to ensure correct rendering of the materials. The problem lies in intersecting geometry.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/thesis/mt13.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">Which mesh do we render first?</p>
                    <p>Because the alpha blending operator is non-commutative, an order-indepent approach to transparency must be employed at the pixel-level. To do this, a separate transparency pass is used utilizing two separate render buffers - a revealage buffer which stores pre-multiplied alpha values and an accumulation buffer that stores color values multiplied by the source alpha of incoming fragments.</p>

                    <p>Incoming fragments are weighted by a function that is dependent on distance from camera to allow closer fragments to appear in front of further-away fragments, thus making the operation order-independent.</p>
                    
                    <h3>High-Dynamic Range Lighting</h3>
                    <p>High-dynamic-range (HDR) rendering is an attempt to simulate two separate phenomena: the ability of the human eye to perceive detail in a large lighting range within the same area, and its ability to adapt to large light changes between areas. It is a pipeline change that affects every stage of the rendering process.</p>
                    <p>The first step is to convert to a 16-bit-per-channel color target for scene color. Lighting calculations are done unbounded when objects are rendered, then a post-pass is done on the scene color target to map those color values back down to a 0-1 range. </p>
                    
                    <h4>Tonemapping Operator</h4>
                    <p>The tonemapping operator chosen was taken from John Hable's GDC talk on Uncharted 2's filmic tonemapping. Filmic tonemapping was chosen due to its preservation of the saturation and range in color over something like Reinhardt tonemapping. Below is a screenshot taken from the artifact using no tonemapping, simple Reinhardt tonemapping, and filmic tonemapping.</p>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">No tonemapping applied to the scene</p>

                    <p>Note that filmic tonemapping keeps the saturation and highlights of the scene, without overly darkening it or desaturating it.</p>

                    <h4>Auto-Eye Adaption</h4>
                    <p>Auto-eye adaption is a phenomenon most notable when going from an indoor environment to an outdoor one or vice-versa. The outdoor area may seem blown out and extremely bright when viewing it through a doorway, but those values soon dim down and everything comes into view as the character steps outside. There are many techniques to accomplish this effect, and the one chosen for this thesis was auto-exposure volumes.</p>
                    <p>When the player enters an exposure volume, the current exposure is interpolated to the target exposure. If the player is not in an exposure volume, the default exposure level specified for the scene is used.</p>

                    <h3>Dynamic Environment Mapping</h3>
                    <p>Dynamic environment mapping was a small portion of the thesis, designed to understand the process of rendering the scene multiple times for a variety of different reasons (shadows, pre-depth, etc). The technique itself simply involves writing to a cubemap color target, amortized out to one side per frame.</p>

                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4v4 LAN multiplayer (WiFi or Ethernet)</li>
                        <li>Two game modes: CTF and Bounty</li>
                        <li>Two guns</li>
                        <li>Dynamic, animated HUD</li>
                        <li>Ragdoll death effect</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Cryo Gun</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/velocirapture/v1.gif" />
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/velocirapture/v2.gif" />
                    <br/>
                    <p>The Cryo Gun features two firing modes. The primary firing mode is an automatic machine-gun like mode, then switches to a slower rate of fire when the ammo count reaches 1. The secondary firing mode is a lobby grenade that explodes into smoke clouds when making impact with a surface or player.</p>
                    <p>The primary firing mode raycasts forward from the camera's location, randomized slightly in a small cone. The ammo check is done every time the gun fires, and when it reaches 1 the firing mode switches the cooldown timer to be slower.</p>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Cryo Gun Primary Projectile Blueprint</p>
                    <p>The primary projectile spawns the raycast and particle effect from the server. The player's controller blueprint needs to replicate rotation over the server, or else the projectile blueprints ​won't know where to fire from.</p>

                    <h3>The HUD</h3>
                    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'>
                        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ShamelessHalfAntelope' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >HUD Animations play for a variety of events</p>
                    <p>After the first iteration of the HUD, our team decided to incorporate external feedback that HUD elements looked too bland and unresponsive. It featured no player feedback and didn't feel good when picking up items. It was my responsibility to streamline and liven up the HUD.</p>
                    <p>HUD animations are done using <b>UMG animations</b>, triggered through gameplay events. UMG and <b>Player Controller</b> blueprints are not replicated over the network so gameplay events must be fired through the <b>Game Mode</b> blueprint.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/velocirapture/v4.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Working With UMG Animations</p>
                    <p>Events were fired from the Game Mode blueprint that pickups were grabbed, so the HUD element didn't have to poll for changes. This ensured that the HUD remained responsive and only encapsulated functionality to play the animations.</p>

                    <p>To get the ragdoll to react appropriately, it needed an impulse applied to the last point of contact with the bullet. When a player dies, a <b>Ragdoll character</b> is spawned. The bullet impact velocity and the name of the bone hit are then sent to it. After construction, it applies the impact velocity as an impulse on the bone hit.</p>

                    <h4>What Went Well</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We succeeded in having good communication channels</li>
                        <li>The final product is very cohesive</li>
                        <li>Team wasn’t afraid of interdisciplinary work</li>
                        <li>Team grew their skills, even in areas that weren’t our specialty</li>
                        <li>Design and programming maintained clear communication channels</li>
                        <li>Team was well-organized</li>
                        <li>We recovered from losing a team member well - especially the programmers</li>
                        <li>We maintained a positive working environment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What Went Wrong</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cohesive vision is necessary early on</li>
                        <li>Need more bug testing and play testing - focused too much on things we were currently</li>
                        <li>working on, instead of testing implemented features for balance and completeness</li>
                        <li>Some tasks overran their bounds, and team members got tunnel vision</li>
                        <li>At the beginning, there was too much talk about design, and not enough experimenting</li>
                        <li>All team members should have worked on getting assets into the game sooner, then iterate - rather than trying to make the first pass the best</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What We Learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved time estimates across the team over project</li>
                        <li>Iteration is not only good, it’s necessary - get it working, then get it pretty</li>
                        <li>Prove your pipelines as early as possible</li>
                        <li>Experimentation is valuable - especially at the beginning</li>
                        <li>Don’t get too attached to your work - Cut features if it makes sense for the game</li>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mobile puzzle game built in Unity3D for Android mobile platforms</li>
                        <li>Served as Lead Developer on a team of 4 (2 programmers)</li>
                        <li>Responsibilities included: Managed team tasks and pipelines, implemented basic puzzle mechanics, puzzle sequencing, and end-game sequencing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Base Puzzle Mechanics</h3>
                    <center><img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/doctorsnote/dn1.png" /></center>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >The base mechanism for placing gears on pegs and spark effects</p>
                    <p>Interaction is done with the Unity3D event trigger system. This ensures that interaction is cross-platform with no additional overhead.</p>
                    <p>There are a set number of gears in the game that pan into view when a level is completed, and each is given its own event triggers for dragging, picking up, and putting down.</p>
                    <p>The gear objects hold functionality for transferring rotation between nearby gears - It loops through the ~20 gears in the game, checks the distance between them, and if they're close enough initiates rotation and tells them to check for additional nearby gears. This allows a chain-reaction of sorts when gears are put in place.</p>
                    <center><img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/doctorsnote/dn2.png" /></center>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Creating the sliding pipe mechanism</p>
                    <p>The original prototype for the third level sliding pipe was built by asking whether there was a gear close enough to the pipe and sliding the pipe in a hard-coded direction.</p>
                    <p>During vertical slice, we implemented a line-normal detection algorithm that takes an angle and detects the closest gear's distance to its own line segment to see if it was "touching" the teeth or not.</p>
                    <center><img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/doctorsnote/dn3.png" /></center>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >The on / off peg mechanism</p>
                    <p>The fourth and fifth puzzles use a simple on / off peg mechanism that turns on an attached peg if a rotating pipe is in the right place. Pegs marked as "on / off" pegs check to see if they're associated pipe is at the right angle, and if it is, powers the associated regular peg.</p>
                    <p>To sell the idea of “turning on” a peg with the power box, a simple procedural lightning particle effect was implemented along with switching the sprites of the power box.</p>

                    <h3>Puzzle Sequencing</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/doctorsnote/dn4.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Creating the puzzle-to-puzzle animation sequence</p>
                    <p>While we originally went with the idea of having various notes laid out in the background of the main game scene so that players got an idea for the general story of Doctor’s Note, it quickly came to our attention that players were not noticing the notes at all. To fix this problem, I designed and implemented a level completion animation that would fade in a theoretical shopping list to juxtapose the dark tone of the game with the “madness” of the mad scientist.</p>
                    <p>This shopping list would fade in after the user completed a puzzle, and an animation kicked off that when finished, the player would have to hit the continue button to move to the next puzzle.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/doctorsnote/dn5.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Creating the end-game sequence</p>
                    <p>Once development kicked off and we had our core mechanics fleshed out, we needed a way for the player to feel like they were actually building something. The designer and I came up with a scheme such that certain mechanical sounds would come to life and others would fade out while background environment pieces would begin moving as the camera panned over to the next puzzle in the game.</p>
                    <p>For our vertical slice milestone, I set out and created the level progression sequencing and connected the artist’s animations to create a more organic progression between puzzles. This also included loading sequences from the main menu UI to the main game scene, and from the UI to the credits sequence shown above.</p>

                    <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                    <h4>What Went Well</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communicated effectively with team members about desires for the game
                        Worked well the other programmer to get things done and have both of us firing on all pistons</li>
                        Meted out tasks effectively and kept everyone focused on the tasks that needed to be accomplished</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>What Went Wrong</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Could have handled the programming workflow with the other programmer at the beginning of the project instead of half-way through</li>
                        <li>Could have been more effective in holding people accountable for the quality of work they were giving me for submission</li>
                        <li>Workflow between all four team members could have been handled more efficiently and elegantly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People have different desires for what they want out of the project and socially, and tapping into those makes them more effective developers</li>
                        <li>Do not be afraid to dive into an unfamiliar codebase and mangle it to your needs</li>
                        <li>Game development workflow is not a simple problem space, and how to efficiently handle it is a hard problem</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'>
                        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/KeenMilkyBumblebee' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">Chunks stream in and out as you move across the landscape</p>
                    <p>The world is broken into "chunks" - 16x16x128 block groups that stream in and out as the player moves around. At all times, the game manages these chunks in a radius around the player. When the player moves, chunks that are flushed from memory are written out to disk - this ensures that when the player comes back, anything that they built still stays around.</p>
                    <p>Chunks are generated with their heights calculated through a seeded 2D perlin noise function - a randomized, deterministic algorithm that ensures smooth gradients across the world plane. </p>

                    <h3>Biomes</h3>
                    <p>A separately seeded 2D perlin noise function is used to determine world biomes. These perlin grids are used as temperature and humidity in combination with column height. The base perlin noise function returns values between -1 and 1, so we use 0 as our determining factor on "hot", "cold", "wet", and "dry".</p>
                    <p>Water and ice are determined by column heights being less than an arbitrarily defined "sea level".</p>

                    <h3>Rain and Snow Effects</h3>
                    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'>
                        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SingleLimpJellyfish' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">Snow on top of a mountain</p>
                    <p>If a column is marked as MOUNTAIN (It's column height exceeds a certain threshold), snow spawns in that column. If a column is marked as PLAINS (It has high humidity and temperature), rain spawns in that column.</p>
                    <p>For each column marked as snow or rain, 4 weather "sheets" (2D oriented quads) spawn and move downwards toward the ground. Each frame, the weather sheet checks to see if it's bottom is intersecting a block, and moves back up to the top of the column.</p>
                    <p>Clouds (3D axis-aligned rectangular prisms) are spawned randomly above snow and rain columns and move horizontally across the terrain.</p>

                    <h3>Lighting</h3>
                    <div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'>
                        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SecondhandExcitableAmethystinepython' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">Block faces get darker the further down you dig</p>
                    <p>Light propagates using internal, arbitrarily defined light values of blocks that light the faces of surrounding blocks. Every block starts with an internal light value of 1, so that if no light is coming into a concealed area, it will still remain partially visible.</p>
                    <p>When a chunk is first generated, the terrain generator descends each column and marks each air tile as sky. It then reiterates through each column, checks surrounding horizontal neighbors, and "dirties" them if they're not air tiles. Each frame, the algorithm goes through all blocks that need their lighting recalculated and adjusts their internal lighting values to correspond correctly to their neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Blocks only need their lighting recalculated when neighboring blocks are added or removed, ensuring that lighting is not calculated unless it needs to be.</p>

                    <h3>Summary & Features</h3>
                    <ul>

                        <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/UnlawfulFarflungAmazontreeboa' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light">The memory allocation profiler. Includes callstacks for each memory leak on program exit</p>
                    <p>The profiling tools include three separate components:​</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory Allocation Profiler</li>
                        <li>Frame Time and Function Profiler</li>
                        <li>Logger</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The memory allocation profiler was constructed by overloading the new() and delete() operators to push metadata at the head of any allocated buffer.</p>
                    <p>When new() is called and memory profiling output is set to verbose, the memory manager fetches the current callstack of the program and saves it at the beginning of the buffer as well as the rest of the metadata.</p>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Allocated memory buffers called with overloaded new()</p>
                    <p>The metadata for the allocated memory buffer also contains a circular linked list to other memory allocations. This allows for a compact list of all metadata information, with the Memory Manager class only holding a pointer to the start of the linked list.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/chromatica/c2.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >The memory manager metadata circular linked list</p>
                    <p>The circular linked list was the fastest and most compact data structure to hold the collection of allocation metadata, since only the head of the list has to be stored on the memory manager and insertion is done in constant time.</p>

                    <p>The game features 4-person drop-in drop-out multiplayer. When an Xbox Controller is plugged in while the game is running, the player is added into the game. Players play cooperatively while also competing for the highest score, which is displayed when all players have died.</p>

                    <h3>Future Features / Nice to Haves</h3>
                    <p>The collection of entities (Enemies, players, bullets, and particles) should be compact in memory and cache warm at all times since they are looped through every frame and updated / rendered.</p>
                    <p>Currently only the pointers to the entity data are allocated up-front at the start of the game and stay compact and cache warm. In the future, the entity system should allocate entity data up-front and carve out pieces of the buffer to return when a new one is allocated. When an entity dies, the portion of memory is marked free and a new entity can use the data when allocated.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Roguelikes are one of the oldest genres of RPGs - procedurally generated dungeon crawlers with a few key features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Permadeath (If you die, the game is over and you must restart)</li>
                        <li>Ability to save you current game and continue when the application is reloaded</li>
                        <li>Enemy NPCs that can be interacted with, and possibly friendly NPCs</li>
                        <li>Items scattered across the map that can be picked up and used</li>
                        <li>​8 points of movement, turn-based gameplay</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Agent Behaviors</h3>
                    <p>NPCs can be defined with three different behaviors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Melee Attack Player or Enemy NPC</li>
                        <li>Chase Player or Enemy NPC</li>
                        <li>Flee from Player or Enemy NPC</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>NPCs can also be given movement properties that modify the hueristics in their A* pathfinding, stating whether they can move through solid tiles ("flying" movement), Lava, and whether they're blocked by other Agents (the player or other NPCs).</p>
                    <center><img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/paradise/p1.png" /></center>
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Data-driving NPC behaviors and properties</p>
                    <p>A permissive line of sight algorithm is used for both the player and the NPCs using digital bressenham lines spanning out for each agent. NPCs derive utility of their behaviors based on the distance of enemy agents, how low their current health is, and how close they are to certain features in the map.</p>
                    <p>NPCs can also be defined with various faction relationships, so if a goblin sees the player and another enemy faction, but hates the enemy faction more, it will go after the enemy faction instead of the player. They may also see items on the map and pick them up.</p>

                    <h3>NPC Factions</h3>
​                    <p>NPCs can belong to XML-defined factions. Factions have relationships, resulting in NPC in-fighting when they see other NPCs belonging to a "Hated" or "Disliked" faction. If an NPC likes a faction but someone belonging to that faction attacks it, it will note the attack and become hostile to that faction. </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/paradise/p2.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >The player attacks a Hobgoblin while other NPCs flee enemies in the distance.</p>

                    <h3>Data-Driven Design</h3>
                    <p>Entirely new in-game scenarios can be built from the ground up in a relatively short amount of time and touching only the necessary portions of the code. New generators, which must be defined code-side, are self-registering and only require using a template generator class to add themselves into the list of generators.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid inProjectImg" src="assets/images/projects/paradise/p3.png" />
                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Storm the Castle - A scenario with a custom castle map and custom NPC behaviors, built in a little under 5 hours</p>
                    <p>The XML parsing portion of my engine uses a free third party tool called XMLParser, with additional functionality built in to make design as painless as possible. This means that things such as colors can be defined in multiple ways, attribute and node data capitalization doesn't matter, and ordering of nodes is not taken into account.</p>

                    <h3>Taking it Two Steps Further</h3>
                    <p>The basic requirements for the project were deep dives into agent behaviors, XML-driven gameplay and design, and a handful of interesting map generators, all controlled through keyboard input.</p>
                    <p>There was something desperately lacking from example projects of prior students and I was determined to make mine more interesting and playable. The two things that I thought would really elevate the experience were mouse interaction and dynamic tile graphics. Debugging the A* pathing was a breeze because I could visually see the path being drawn where my mouse was located. Being able to mouse over enemies to see data about them felt good and really brought life to the game.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, design-wise, the inventory system may not have been the best idea due to the ASCII nature of the visual interface - you may pick up five different swords that all look the same and can't tell the difference unless you mouse over them.</p>
                    <p>Taking these extra steps really elevated the entire experience and resulted in a more well-crafted adventure. Mouse-based inventory management also felt better and made the game feel more dynamic.</p>
