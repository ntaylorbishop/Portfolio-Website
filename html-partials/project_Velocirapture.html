                    <h3>Cryo Gun</h3>

                    <br/>
                    <p>The Cryo Gun features two firing modes. The primary firing mode is an automatic machine-gun like mode, then switches to a slower rate of fire when the ammo count reaches 1. The secondary firing mode is a lobby grenade that explodes into smoke clouds when making impact with a surface or player.</p>
                    <p>The primary firing mode raycasts forward from the camera's location, randomized slightly in a small cone. The ammo check is done every time the gun fires, and when it reaches 1 the firing mode switches the cooldown timer to be slower.</p>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Cryo Gun Primary Projectile Blueprint</p>
                    <p>The primary projectile spawns the raycast and particle effect from the server. The player's controller blueprint needs to replicate rotation over the server, or else the projectile blueprints ​won't know where to fire from.</p>

                    <h3>The HUD</h3>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >HUD Animations play for a variety of events</p>
                    <p>After the first iteration of the HUD, our team decided to incorporate external feedback that HUD elements looked too bland and unresponsive. It featured no player feedback and didn't feel good when picking up items. It was my responsibility to streamline and liven up the HUD.</p>
                    <p>HUD animations are done using <b>UMG animations</b>, triggered through gameplay events. UMG and <b>Player Controller</b> blueprints are not replicated over the network so gameplay events must be fired through the <b>Game Mode</b> blueprint.</p>

                    <p class="text-center font-weight-light" >Working With UMG Animations</p>
                    <p>Events were fired from the Game Mode blueprint that pickups were grabbed, so the HUD element didn't have to poll for changes. This ensured that the HUD remained responsive and only encapsulated functionality to play the animations.</p>

                    <p>To get the ragdoll to react appropriately, it needed an impulse applied to the last point of contact with the bullet. When a player dies, a <b>Ragdoll character</b> is spawned. The bullet impact velocity and the name of the bone hit are then sent to it. After construction, it applies the impact velocity as an impulse on the bone hit.</p>

                    <h4>What Went Well</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We succeeded in having good communication channels</li>
                        <li>The final product is very cohesive</li>
                        <li>Team wasn’t afraid of interdisciplinary work</li>
                        <li>Team grew their skills, even in areas that weren’t our specialty</li>
                        <li>Design and programming maintained clear communication channels</li>
                        <li>Team was well-organized</li>
                        <li>We recovered from losing a team member well - especially the programmers</li>
                        <li>We maintained a positive working environment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What Went Wrong</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cohesive vision is necessary early on</li>
                        <li>Need more bug testing and play testing - focused too much on things we were currently</li>
                        <li>working on, instead of testing implemented features for balance and completeness</li>
                        <li>Some tasks overran their bounds, and team members got tunnel vision</li>
                        <li>At the beginning, there was too much talk about design, and not enough experimenting</li>
                        <li>All team members should have worked on getting assets into the game sooner, then iterate - rather than trying to make the first pass the best</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What We Learned</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved time estimates across the team over project</li>
                        <li>Iteration is not only good, it’s necessary - get it working, then get it pretty</li>
                        <li>Prove your pipelines as early as possible</li>
                        <li>Experimentation is valuable - especially at the beginning</li>
                        <li>Don’t get too attached to your work - Cut features if it makes sense for the game</li>
                    </ul>
